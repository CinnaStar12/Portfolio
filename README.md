# Portfolio

## Description

This is one of my first created and deployed from the ground up web pages. It is intended to set up a groundwork for a future portfolio website to market myself to prospective employers.

## Usage

It contains an About Me page, which has a short description of myself and my experience. There is also a portfolio page setup. The Cards are placeholders at the moment, but will replaced with working links to projects once I start to build my profile over the course of my studies. Lastly, there is a contact page that will eventually allow visitors to leave messages to me and their email so that i may be able to contact them back.
