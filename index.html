                <p>Hello! My name is Allan Binayao. I was born, raised, and currently reside in Houston, Texas. I am a student of a boot camp run by Univerity of Texas at Austin to learn full-stack web development. I am working as a Senior Guest Advisor at GameStop at the moment, but I am looking to establish a career in the thriving tech industry, something I've wanted to do since i was a child. </p>
                <p>
                    I am an incredibly passionate person. I enjoy coffee, video games, music, motorsports, and a lot more. I'm also always willing to learn and adapt to new concepts. Recently, I've been working to overcome a severe anxiety disorder that had been holding me back. I wasn't sure what I was doing with my life for a while. Once I sought professional help, I started to gain confidence in myself and began to engage my self in things I previously would be uncomfortable with. Now I'm taking strides to secure my future.
                </p>
